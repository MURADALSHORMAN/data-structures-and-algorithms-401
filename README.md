Singly Linked List
Code Challenges 05 , 06

# Challenge
- Challenge 05: Create three prototype functions for single linked list class; insert, include, and toString

- Challenge 06: Create three prototype functions of linked list class; append, insert after, and insert before;

# Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task. Big O space is O(1) and time is O(n);
